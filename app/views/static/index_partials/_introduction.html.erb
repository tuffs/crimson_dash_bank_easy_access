    <p id="introduction_paragraph__who_are_we">
      We are happy to invite you into our community of dashers who are seeking to improve the payment system options for their hard work. Continue to review the informaton on this website. You should learn that there are simple payout procedures and processes which have
      been designed to pay out immediately and directly to your bank account in a manner that is both safe and secure. We believe that dashers should have the option to be paid immmediately to a US bank account that is FDIC insured and that has a support network that operates just like any bank you can sign up for in the United States. You deserve to be in control of your money and be able to speak with a real Banker about your fiduciary status. We are here to help you achieve that goal.
